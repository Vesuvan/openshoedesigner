<h1>Open Shoe Designer -&nbsp; Users Manual<br />
</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

This software is intended for shoe design. It consists of a
lastgenerator, that uses a model of the foot to generate the last. The
shoe is designed onto the last. Patterns for the upper part of the shoe
are generated from the design. Pattern / models for the sole are
generated as well.<br />
<br />
To generate the form of the last this software modells the bones and
the skin surrounding the bones in the foot. An volume model of the foot
is constructed. This model is modified to distrubute the forces on the
foot by the shoe. For example You want a tight hold across the span,
but You do not want any forces on the toes or directly from the front
on the bones. Depending on the heel height the last has to be adapted
around the heel to prevent the foot slipping out of the shoe. Also no
moments have to be applied on the ancles from the side while standing
straight. <br />
These modification result in the last.<br />
<br />
By setting up a coordinate system on he last and defining the pattern
with respect to this coordinate system, the form of the last and the
design of the pattern can be kept separately. A shoe can be adapted to
a new wearer by simply exchanging the last. Even changes to the
inclination and heel height of a shoe can be changed after the design
has been finished. <br />
<br />
By using this approach, the manufacturer can easiely adapt the design
to a whole range of lasts and also easiely create different forms based
for the typical foot forms in differnt places of the planet and adapt
the design to differnt toe forms: Egyptian, Greek or Roman foot.<br />
<h3>Foot model<br />
</h3>

The basic foot model is based upon a skeletal model. The length and the
diameters of the bones are adapted until the foot fits an e.g. outline
drawing with differnt grith measurements or a 3D scan of the of the
foot. The skin thickness and density is estimated as well. It is used
to model the compressibility of the foot under different forces.<br />
For the upper part of the leg simple length and circumfence measurements are used. <br />
<h3>
Lasts<br />
</h3>

In the process of shoemaking the last assists the shoemaker in constructing a well fitting shoe. <br />
It hels forming the leather to give the wearer of the shoe a snug fit without squeezig the foot.<br />
<br />
For industrial shoes there is a trend to simplify the lasts more and more. <br />
<h2>Shoesizes<br />
</h2>

Almost ever country has its own system for measuring shoe sizes.<br />
Here is an overview on the different systems.<br />
<h3>
Europe<br />
</h3>

The length of the last in Parisian Point ("Pariser Punkt").<br />
One Parisian Point is 2/3 of a centimeter. <br />
<br />
EU size = (Footlength + 2 cm) * 2 / 3 cm<br />
<br />
in Europe the shoesizes are normal distributed. <br />
For female sizes the mean shoesize is at 39 with a standard deviation
of 2. For males the mean is at 41 and the standard deviation is 3.<br />
<h3>
USA<br />
</h3>

Different systems for male and female feet. The formulas are:<br />
<h3>
Japan<br />
</h3>

They use a direct measurement of the lengh of the foot in cm as their shoe sizeing system.<br />
<h3>
UK<br />

<h2>Shoestyles<br />
</h2>

There are many styles. I reference here the styles mentioned by Oskar
Belsching in his standard volume on industrial shoemaking. These styles
are optimized for efficient production in large numbers.<br />
<br />
Modern styles are almost always deviations of these styles. To sell
shoes in high volumes, it is necessary to keep with the tast of the
masses. Very exotic and out-of-the-norm designs are not selling very
well. If You want to walk this way You have to start from one of the
standart designs and improvise from there.<br />
<br />
The pattern generator uses these standard designs to generate templates
of the upper part of the shoe. It uses the templates and tries to
stretch them around the last / the extended last (with leg).<br />
<h2>History<br />
</h2>

A shoes main purpose is to protect the feet. To keep them warm and to
repell dirt and water. The shoe as an fashion-statement only happened
recently. Starting in noble circles the shoe shloly started loosing its
function as means of protecting the foot, because the environment hey
were worn in was not as spoiled as it was for the peasents. The shoe as
a status symbol came into fashion.<br />
later the strong separation between the work-shoes of the common people
and the fashion shoes of the [hohen Herrschaften] diffused more and
more and mixed into what was to become the modern shoe. As the
boiundaries shmeared a. wide variety of styles came into existence. Not
on the axis of status but on the axis of purpose. <br /></body></html>
